How to make amla oil:
Steps for making amla oil from fresh or dried amla fruits, or juice, at home include:

Grate or blend 1 cup of dried, fresh, or frozen amla fruit or juice.
Extract the juice of the amla fruits by squeezing and straining then through a sieve over a cup or bowl.
Measure 1 tablespoon of oil. Many people use extra virgin oils, such as coconut, olive, or sesame, to ensure the base is as pure, and potent, as possible.
Mix the amla fruit or powder and oil together for several minutes, or until the mixture looks uniform. Many people use a blender or whip the mixture.
If using solid oils, heat the mixture on a very low heat until the oil has fully melted and mixed in.
While the mixture is still slightly warm, apply the oil to the scalp for one or two hours, then rinse off. The mixture can also be left on overnight or until the next shower or bath. The mixture can also be applied to the skin and left on.
